Stop legacy systems migration, let’s deal with them properly.<br/><br/>

Migration is a valid approach sometimes, however, migrating looking for feature parity is an investment waste most of the time, doing the same in another technology, does not represent any benefit for the business that is looking for new features and products. Failed migrations are the daily bread, endless migrations due to a change of priorities and or reduction of budgets or migrations that are born legacy or obsolete due to the vertiginous change of technology, are common problems that must be addressed. Migration is not always the answer.<br/><br/>

“We migrate and then we move quickly.” Although at first glance it looks like a wise solution, the problem of migrations looking for a feature parity is that the benefit is perceived only when the migration is complete, because it is only at that moment when they can add the new functionality that the business required, however, the objective is to obtain the benefits from the first moment of the investment, and not at the end when the budget may no longer exist, or the priority of the initiatives has changed.<br/><br/>

Migrating systems looking for feature parity to a new architecture often implies an endless road, where the moment the migration “ends”, there will have appeared so many new tools and technologies that the new version will be obsolete or legacy even before seeing the light.<br/><br/>

This talk focuses on patterns and techniques to deal with legacy systems so that problems can be faced without the need to migrate the systems completely to obtain the benefit, but by generating business value from early stages, making small integrations and partial migrations with rapid benefits. avoiding large investments that expand the profit with future bets that do not always come to light.<br/><br/>

We will see how with the use of patterns such as autonomous bubble, anti-corruption layers, open host, etc. and the proper use of an event architecture for the synchronization of data sources, we can satisfy the business requirements by integration and partial migrations without the need to migrate the legacy applications completely but by dealing with them permanently.<br/><br/>
